# Python Requests Library Homework

Welcome! This homework is designed for students who just learned the basics of the Python `requests` library, specifically using `get` requests and working with JSON responses. You do **not** need to use URL parameters (`params`) or the `post` method. Each task uses a simple, public API that doesn't require authentication.

**Instructions:**
- Use the `requests` library to complete each task.
- Use only the `get` method and handle the JSON response with `.json()`.
- Print your results in a clear, readable way.
